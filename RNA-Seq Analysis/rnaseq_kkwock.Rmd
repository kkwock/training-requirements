## Requirements

To complete this task, you should perform the DGE analysis using [DESeq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html) and generate these tables and figures in an RMarkdown file (`.Rmd`):

1.  PCA summarizing the sample-level variance within the data set.
2.  MA Plot showing the relationship between mean count and log2 fold change.
3.  Table listing the differentially-expressed genes (DEGs)
4.  Volcano plot showing all DGE results.
5.  Heatmap showing the top 10 over- and under-expressed DEGs.
6.  Enrichment analysis showing the top over- and under-expressed KEGG pathways.
    -   Create a figure & a table to summarize the results
